# Data Analyst Internship Project: PowerBI Dashboard

## Project Overview:
This project was completed during my internship at ExcelR as a Data Analyst. It focuses on analyzing e-commerce data to extract insights into customer behavior and payment statistics. The dataset provided includes information about orders, payment types, review scores, delivery dates, and customer locations. The objective was to create a PowerBI dashboard to visualize these insights effectively.

## Dashboard Components:
### 1. Weekday Vs Weekend Payment Statistics:
Visualization comparing the number of orders with a review score of 5 and payment type as credit card between weekdays and weekends.

### 2. Average Delivery Time for Pet Shop Orders:
Analysis of the average number of days taken for orders to be delivered to customers for pet shop-related purchases.

### 3. Average Price and Payment Values in São Paulo City:
Insights into the average price and payment values from customers located in São Paulo city.

### 4. Shipping Days Vs Review Scores Relationship:
Exploration of the relationship between shipping days (order delivery time) and review scores, aiming to identify any correlation between them.
